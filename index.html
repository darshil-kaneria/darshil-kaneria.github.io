  <div class="stackedit__html"><h1 id="hi-im-darshil-wave">Hi, I’m Darshil 👋</h1>
<p>I’m a graduate student at Carnegie Mellon University in the Information Networking Department advised by Professor Srinivasan Seshan. My academic/research interests lie at the intersection of congestion control and low-latency streaming. Beyond that, I like to work on projects in the field of networking, distributed systems, software engineering, and compiler design.</p>
<p>Outside of work, I enjoy going on long drives. I also like to cook Indian food (which almost always ends up <em>not</em> looking like the photo on the recipe website). Oh, and video games.</p>
